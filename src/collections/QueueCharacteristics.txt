Key Characteristics of Queues:
- FIFO Ordering: The first element added is the first element removed.
- Capacity Restrictions: Some queue implementations may have a fixed capacity, while others are dynamically resizable.
- Specialized Subtypes: Includes `Deque` for double-ended queues, and `BlockingQueue` for thread-safe queues with blocking operations.
