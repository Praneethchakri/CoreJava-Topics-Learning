What is Java Reflection
	• Java Reflection is a powerful language part of  JVM feature that gives us the RUN Time access to the information about our application  classes and objects
	• Those features are available to us though reflection API
What we can do with Java Reflection?
	• Using Reflection API we can write flexible code that links different software components together at runtime.
	• Creates new program flow without any source code modifications.
	• Reflection allow writing general purpose algorithms that dynamically adapt and changes their behavior based on the type of objects or classes they are working on.
The major ability of Java Reflection API's  , to analyze the applications Object and classes at runtime
	With this feature we can create 
		○ Libraries
		○ Frameworks
		○ Software designs


Reflection use Case and Examples
1.Junit- Standard Framework for unit testing of java applications
	Eg: Without Reflection we need to manually     
	 create the object to test with mock data                            
	Public class CarTest{
	
		Public void setUp(){}
		Public void testDrive(){}
		Public void testBrake(){}
	
	Main(){
	
	CarTest obj = CarTest();
		Obj.setUp();
		Obj.testDrive();
		Obj.setUp();
		Obj.testBrake();
}

With Reflection we can avoid the boiler plate code that create of object and other

Public class CarTest{
	@Before
	Public void setUp(){}
	@Test
	Public void testDrive(){}
	@Test
	Public void testBrake(){}
	}

/*
Main(){

CarTest obj = CarTest();
	Obj.setUp();
	Obj.testDrive();
	Obj.setUp();
	Obj.testBrake();
	*/
}

	2. Dependency Injection
		a. Spring/Spring Boot
		b. Google Guice
	3. Json Serialization and Deserialization
		a. Jackson
		b. Gson
	4. Other Popular use cases include
		a. Logging Frameworks
		b. ORM(Object Relational Mapping tools)
		c. Web Frameworks
		d. Developer tools
	5. Architecting our own applications
	
		

Java Reflection challenges
	1. If we use incorrectly ,not for the right purpose
	2.  it will make our code slow and hard to maintain
	3. Dangerous to execute, could crash unrecoverable
